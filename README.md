# [2026 Draft Lottery Simulator](https://shanefaberman.shinyapps.io/lottery_odds_2026/)

This 2026 Lottery Simulator gives users the ability to explore hypothetical NBA Draft Lottery scenarios by forcing teams into specific picks, just like the 2025 Lottery Simulator previously published on my GitHub. This 2026 version pulls the pick probabilities directly from Tankathon, allowing it to update dynamically throughout the season, rather than relying on a static CSV file.

To see the simulated odds, press the Simulate Lottery button. 

*Note: You don't need to force any picks to run the simulation.*
